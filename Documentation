Perfect 👏 — you’ve built a complete CRM System with Spring Boot (Java + PostgreSQL) and a simple HTML/JS frontend, so now you need a professional, detailed project documentation.

Below is a complete, ready-to-submit documentation template that you can copy directly into a Word or PDF file.
It covers every section (introduction → architecture → setup → testing → conclusion) in a clean, professional format.

🧾 CRM Management System — Project Documentation

🏷️ Project Overview

Project Title: CRM Management System
Technology Stack: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.6, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Build Tool: Maven
Testing Framework: JUnit 5, Mockito
IDE Used: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
Version Control: Git / GitHub (optional)

🔹 Objective

The CRM Management System is a simple yet functional web application that allows managing:

Customers

Transactions

Interactions

Tasks


The system supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through REST APIs and a lightweight web frontend built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript served by Spring Boot.


---

🏗️ System Architecture

The architecture follows a 3-layered design:

1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)

Implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Communicates with backend APIs via fetch() calls.

Displays dynamic data (customers, transactions, etc.) in interactive tables.



2. Business Layer (Backend - Spring Boot)

RESTful controllers handle HTTP requests.

Services contain business logic.

Uses Dependency Injection (@Service, @Autowired) for loose coupling.



3. Data Layer (Database - PostgreSQL)

Stores persistent data for all entities.

Managed via Spring Data JPA (JpaRepository).

Tables auto-created using spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update.

⚙️ Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Prerequisites

Java 21

Maven 3.9+

PostgreSQL 15+

An IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse)


2️⃣ Database Setup

1. Open pgAdmin or terminal.


2. Create a database:

CREATE DATABASE crmdb;


3. Update credentials in application.properties:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/crmdb
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true




---

3️⃣ Build and Run the Application

Using IDE:

Run CrmSystemApplication.java


Using Command Line:

mvn spring-boot:run


---

4️⃣ Access the Application

Open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:8080

You’ll see the CRM frontend UI.

Use it to add, edit, and delete Customers and Transactions.

🔗 REST API Endpoints

Customer APIs

Method	Endpoint	Description

GET	/api/customers	Get all customers
GET	/api/customers/{id}	Get customer by ID
POST	/api/customers	Create new customer
PUT	/api/customers/{id}	Update customer
DELETE	/api/customers/{id}	Delete customer


Transaction APIs

Method	Endpoint	Description

GET	/api/transactions	Get all transactions
GET	/api/transactions/{id}	Get transaction by ID
POST	/api/transactions	Add new transaction
PUT	/api/transactions/{id}	Update transaction
DELETE	/api/transactions/{id}	Delete transaction


(Similarly for Interactions and Tasks)


---

🧪 Testing

The project includes unit and controller tests using:

JUnit 5

Mockito

Spring Boot Test


Test Coverage

Service layer tests: Validate CRUD logic with mock repositories.

Controller layer tests: Validate REST endpoints using MockMvc.


Example Command:

mvn test

You should see:

BUILD SUCCESS
Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Skipped: 0
